      <description>Resume:pdf
I was originally born in Thailand and had been living there for a half of my life. During my senior year, I had an amazing opportunity of being an THA-USA exchange student for a year. Needless to say it was so awesome that I had to comeback again for college.
Most of my projects were solely inspired by my passion and some problems that I have to deal with every day.</description>
