Resume:[pdf](/resume/SchwinP.pdf)

I was originally born in Thailand and had been living there for a half of my life. During my senior year, I had an amazing opportunity of being an THA-USA exchange student for a year. Needless to say it was so awesome that I had to comeback again for college.

<!--When I was a freshman in college, I had an amzing  group of friends who did a lot of great stuff, some of them develop web apps, some write an Android app, some works on microcontroller. We spent days and nights working on some of the stupidly fun stuffs for years that I was greatly influenced by their skills. You could say that I absorbed and learned some of their skills. This made me who I am, as a developer today.-->

Most of my projects were solely inspired by my passion and some problems that I have to deal with every day. Some of them were inspired by what I felt like doing at a time. Some of them were developed because I got a new toys for christmas to play with.
